                <h2>My contribution</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, I was responsible for implementing several core gameplay features based on the requests from design side.
                    I was responsible for implementing the logic behind the new gameplay features, including analytics, tutorials, and everything related.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the gameplay features I implemented was the money vault. Which let the user gain coins while offline and retrieve them when entering the game again.

                <h2>My contribution</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, I was responsible for implementing and optimizing several core features that enhanced both the gameplay experience and the technical performance of the game.
                    I implemented analytic events, enabling data-driven decision-making, and ads placements for monetization purposes. Additionally, I also added in-app placements.
                    <br><br>
                    I was also involved in building and optimizing the gameplay systems. This included coding the logic behind new hunter characters and their unique abilities, as well as developing the framework for quests, game modes, and innovative game mechanics. I worked closely with the game design team to ensure these features were well-integrated and balanced within the gameplay loop.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the features I implemented was a quests system so that players could level up hunters to unlock new possibilities with them. This system was designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for easy addition of new quests and challenges in the future.

                    I cannot share too much information about this project, but I can say that I was responsible for implementing the logic behind some core game mechanics and other meta features.

                <h2>Objects pool</h2>
                <p>
                    A ready-to-use package that handles objects instantiation via object pool using Unity's object pool system.

                <p>
                    This system let us use tickets for handling behaviours so that we can avoid, for example, unpausing the game if there's a pause ticket still active.

                <p>
                    Quick and easy to use logger system. It allows you to log messages in a very simple way. I have some updates in mind that I will implement in the future.

                    A personal project in which I aimed to take on the challenge of developing a highly ambitious game. It is still in development.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use Zenject as our dependency injector, which has allowed us to scale the code and optimize the use of services in a very simple way.
                    Additionally, we have also implemented Unity Analytics for future use, to evaluate which would be the best direction to take the development based on player performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiple possibilities have been implemented for player control at the level, offering a dynamic, fast-paced, and fun gameplay experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The damage system has been designed so that we can easily control the properties of each attack: damage value, whether it can be countered, and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The save system is based on encrypted JSON files and is centralized, making it very easy for developers to add new information to be saved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Bread of the Wild, you help Bro advance on his ninja training by delivering those breads to an unknown receiver through a sequence of levels based on platforms and obstacles avoidance.
                    The game is based on games like "Celeste", "Super meat boy" and "I wanna be the guy".
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to character control, other elements I would like to highlight are the interactive objects you can find inside the game. You can easily create new ones making it possible to add new levels really quickly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The game can also be played on Android devices and will son be available on Google‚Äôs Play Store.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    ScriptableObjects has greatly improved project optimization. They have been used on the audio, interactions and levels systems.

                    GameJam project. The aim of the player is to avoid skeletons to reach the castle doors by tapping the inputs they have on their head. The limitation we had to implement is the gameplay coulnd't last more than 20 seconds.

                    This is a personal project. As soon as I finished this master degree and outside of work I wanted to develop my own games and this is the first one that came out on Play Store.

                <p>
                    I was really interested on creating a videogame with fast and enjoyable matches. I decided to release the game on Android because it is easier to reach more people.

                    I feel especially proud of enemies‚Äô behaviour. The way it was created makes it very easy to create new ones without coding. Including Google‚Äôs API is also something I am proud of.

                    This game was developed during a GameJam, an event where several groups of people have to develop a videogame in 48 hours. High Five was awarded the prize for the best game and art direction, making it the winner of this game jam. The game was developed by a team made of six people, what improved my skill when working as a part of a development team.
