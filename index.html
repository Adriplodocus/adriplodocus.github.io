                    <h2>Hi, I'm Adrián Durán García.</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am passionate about video games and everything that surrounds them. To me, they are not just entertainment—they are true works of art and powerful sources of learning. This passion led me to go beyond playing them and begin exploring how they are made from the inside out.
                    </p> 

                    <h2>What do I do</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a game developer with a passion for creating innovative and engaging experiences. My main objectives are to be part of a creative team, constantly learn new skills, and contribute to the development of unique games that push boundaries.
                    </p>

                    <h2>On my free time</h2>
                    <p>
                        Developing is one of the things I do when I have some free time. I am focused on videogames but would like to broaden my horizons. That is why I am currently studying a master degree on apps development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Playing videogames and sharing what I like has always been something I really liked. So I decided to stream some of the videogames I play on Twitch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also like photography and would like to study something related in the future. But I will keep it as a hobby.
                    </p>
