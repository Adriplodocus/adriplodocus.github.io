                                Video games have been my greatest passion since childhood—not just as entertainment, but also as sources of learning. This passion drove me to explore how they are made and eventually become a game developer.

                                I started with the Atari 2600 and NES, but my interest truly grew with the arrival of the original PlayStation. After that, games like the Dark Souls saga (including Sekiro), Lineage II, and Final Fantasy X left a lasting impact on me.

                <h2>What do I do</h2>
                <p>
                    My main objectives are to be part of a creative team, constantly learn new skills, and contribute to the development of unique games that push boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my training in this field, I've actively participated in various activities related to the gaming industry, including conferences, game jams, and the development of personal projects. I have tangible experience, including the publishing of a game on the Play Store and the development of several projects hosted on Itch.io.

                <h2>My spare time</h2>
                <p>
                    I spend some of my free time developing, mainly focusing on video games. Lately, I've been expanding into app development to broaden my skill set.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also play videogames with an analytical mindset, always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn from the experiences they offer.
