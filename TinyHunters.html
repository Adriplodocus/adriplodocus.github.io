            <h2>My contribution</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I was responsible for implementing and optimizing several core features that enhanced both the gameplay experience and the technical performance of the game.
                I implemented analytic events, enabling data-driven decision-making, and ads placements for monetization purposes. Additionally, I also added in-app placements.
                <br><br>
                I was also involved in building and optimizing the gameplay systems. This included coding the logic behind new hunter characters and their unique abilities, as well as developing the framework for quests, game modes, and innovative game mechanics. I worked closely with the game design team to ensure these features were well-integrated and balanced within the gameplay loop.
                <br><br>
                One of the features I implemented was a quests system so that players could level up hunters to unlock new possibilities with them. This system was designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for easy addition of new quests and challenges in the future.
